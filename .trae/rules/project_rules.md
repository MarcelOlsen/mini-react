IMPORTANT! All changes should be grouped up into concern branches, which consist of conventional atomic commits.

## Commit Message Format

```
<emoji> <type>: <subject>
```

with the subject being a short description of the change, once sentence max; the emoji should be appropriatly chosen from the gitmoji list.

Every commit should concern itself with just one small change, and should be atomic.

Every files thats touched, should be ran through Biome to ensure it passes linting and follows all of its recommendations.
